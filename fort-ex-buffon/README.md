Buffon's needle problem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem
A Fortran example

Buffon's needle - geometric probability experiment
lines are parallel to x-axis, with separation t (position of the needle on x-axis is irrelevant)
needle length: l, with position of the mid-point on the y-axis: y, and orientation angle a
generate random needle: y=[0,t] and a=[0,PI]
n_tot: number of needles dropped
n_hit: number of needles that crossed the line
A Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the value of PI
