## Fortran Examples

Here we some of the examples that is written in the Fortran language.
These examples include tricks and techniques that could prove to be useful.

---

### Buffon's Needles

Simulate the Buffon needle drop experiment, a geometric probability calculation to estimate the value of PI.

### colors

We sometimes wish to display colors in our program output, here shows some of the codes that could achieve that.

### makefile

We show that when a Fortran program is written in many separate files and modules with complicated dependencies.
We can organize these files in separate folders and group the dependencies using a well designed makefile.
Required ***makedepf90***
